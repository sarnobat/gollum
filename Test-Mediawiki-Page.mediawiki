The chasm at the top of Spanish soccer can be explained by the league's broadcast agreements. Teams negotiate their deals individually, with Real Madrid and Barcelona accounting for around 40% of the domestic broadcast revenue for Spanish clubs, according to Deloitte. They also raked in 69% of the league's commercial revenue in 2011-12. Atlético, meanwhile, had revenues of $165 million last year, a quarter of Barcelona and Real Madrid's.

===== Wikipedia =====

In 1919, the Compañía Urbanizadora Metropolitana — the company that ran the underground communication system in Madrid—acquired some land, near the Ciudad Universitaria. And in 1921, Athletic Madrid became independent of parent-club Athletic Bilbao. As part of that project the company built a sports stadium, named Estadio Metropolitano de Madrid and Athletic had a new a 35,800 seat home.[8

Fortunately for Los Colchoneros the Spanish Civil War gave the club a reprieve, because Real Oviedo was unable to play due to the destruction of their stadium during the bombings. Thus both La Liga and Athletic's relegation were postponed, the latter by winning a playoff against CA Osasuna, champion of the Segunda División tournament.

A season later the title is lost on the last day of the season against Valencia.

==== 1946 Real Madrid took up residence at Atletico Madrid's Estadio Metropolitano ====
http://estadiosdeespana.blogspot.com/2011/08/madrid-estadio-santiago-bernabeu.html

The new build was on the old stadium’s doorstep, so close in fact that the north east corner of the old Chamartin encroached onto the new stadium’s ground plan. Work continued on the other three sides and Real Madrid finished off the 1945-46 season, before finally closing the doors of the old Chamartin in May 1946. The new stadium took a further 18 months to complete and so Real Madrid took up residence at Atletico Madrid’s Estadio Metropolitano. Finally, on 14 December 1947, Real entertained Belenenses of Portugal in the inaugural match at the Nuevo Estadio Chamartin.

=== 1950s ===

* Back-to-back league titles under Helenio Herrera
** Went on to achieve greater success with Inter using the same catenaccio
<!-- * Madrid Derby in European Cup Semi Finals (1959) -->
* Famous chants
* Black players in 1950s
** Vava
** Jones
** Pereira (not 1950s)
** Benbarek

==== 1951 Helenio Herrera ====

Catenaccio was derived from the Swiss “verrou” (door-bolt) system, invented by Austrian manager Karl Rappan during his managerial spells with Servette and the Swiss national team in the thirties and forties.

Inter won back-to-back European Cups (and Intercontinental Cups) in 1964 and 1965 

Herrera didn't win any trophies after 1968
===== Herrera: More than just catenaccio =====
http://www.fifa.com/news/y=2013/m=4/news=herrera-more-than-just-catenaccio-2061007.html

Herrera then moved into coaching and quickly excelled in his new role, managing Stade Francais and assisting the French national team before moving to Spain, where he helped keep newly-promoted Real Valladolid in the top flight. That achievement in turn earned him the top job at Atletico Madrid, where he rose to fame by winning the league in 1949/50 and 1950/51, and drew attention with his working methods.

Three former Atleti players had particularly vivid memories of working under Herrera. "He was a monster," said defender Alfonso Aparicio. "He used to make us train like crazy for up to three hours every day, but it meant that when Sunday came we could demolish anyone." Ramon Cobo, another former Atleti defender, had this to say of him:  "It's not true that he used to exploit players. He just insisted on thorough preparation, and on leading the right lifestyle for sporting success."

Herrera's subsequent spells at Malaga, Deportivo La Coruna, Sevilla and Belenenses were trophyless, but that did not deter Barcelona. The Catalan club appointed him coach in 1958, putting him in charge of a squad that features stars such as Ladislao Kubala, Zoltan Czibor, Sandor Kocsis and Luis Suarez.
===== herrera at barcelona =====
In La Liga, Herrera delivered the title in his first season. That meant qualification to the European Cup. In 1959/60, Barça reached the semi-finals and met Madrid, who were yet to lose in the competition. For the first leg, in the capital, Herrera dropped Kubala, and Barça lost 3-1. The return leg ended with the same score, meaning a 6-2 aggregate loss. 

==== 1959 European Cup semi final vs Real Madrid ====
<!-- As we come within touching distance of a major trophy, I'd like to remind our euphoric fans (myself included) that we haven't won anything yet and give a historical reminder of 2 of the biggest moments in our history where we failed and what could still happen. -->
 
The glory years of Helenio Herrera were over and Atletico needed rebuilding. The late 50s and early 60s were another period of great achievement, started by coach Fernando Daucik. Leading the line for Atletico was Vava, the only player to score in consecutive World Cup finals. Real Madrid's European Cup win the previous season allowed 2nd-place Atletico to qualify for the competition. The first leg at the Bernabeu (renamed from Chamartin 4 years earlier) saw Atletico lead for 2 minutes in front of 120,000 spectators with an early goal by Chuzo but trail 2-1 at the end of the half and the end of the 1st leg. Atletico won the 2nd leg 1-0 with a goal shortly before half time through Collar. Away goals were 6 years away from being introduced by UEFA and so the teams were level. The tie would be decided via a replay at the Romerado in Zaragoza (that would be the scene of great joy 37 years later when Diego Simeone and company would win half of the 1996 double). Di Stefano's early opener was cancelled out 2 minutes later by Collar, but Puskas would score the deciding goal just before half time and go on to win the final. Atletico's 2 successive Copa Del Rey final wins against Real in the 24 months that followed, led by ex-Real coach José Villalonga Llorente would not erase this major setback in Atletico's history.
 
<!-- real-atletico-europa--644x362.jpg -->

=== 1960s ===
Atletico Madrid's history is characterized by cup joy and agony. The early 1960s attest to this.

* The 60-61 Cups or how to defeat at his home the multi champions. Twice.
* 1962 world cup - Spain???s 2 goalscorers were Atletico players, and the team was managed by Helenio Herrera and captained by Collar also of Atletico.
* Cup Winners Cup - finalists in successive years
* Opening of the Vicente Calderon
** http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybVkq9if4ho
* Luis Aragones - 40 years of service
* Jose Villalonga Llorente - guided Spain to success in the 1964 European Championship (Aragones was not the first), I just realized it was he who guided Atletico to back-to-back wins over Real Madrid in the cup in 1960 and 1961, and won the Cup Winners Cup against Fiorentina at Hampden Park. He left to take charge of Spain. All this after leading Real Madrid to the first ever European Cup trophy (as the youngest ever winner at age 36).


==== 1961 Leicester City ====

==== 1962 World Cup ====

==== 1963 B-team founding ====

==== 1966 Borussia Dortmund ====
I can't find any video of this, but in 1966 Borussia Dortmund won the Cup Winners Cup at Hampden, beating Atletico Madrid along the way:

http://www.infoatleti.es/partido/19660216
http://www.infoatleti.es/partido/19660302

What's interesting is that 3 of those players in the Dortmund team also started the World Cup final 4 months later. The goalkeeper Tilkowski was the man (not) beaten by Geoff Hurst's extra time goal at Wembley.
=== 1970s ===

* Aragones captained Spain once in 1970 and scored in that game
* 1971 - lost European Cup Semi Finals to Ajax (with a 24 year old Johan Cruyff, coached by Rinus Michels). Ajax would go on to win their 1st of 3 consecutive European cups. Dutch football was in the early years of its first golden era. The previous 2 finals involved dutch sides, and before the decade was over the national team had reached back to back world cup finals
* 60s and 70s dominated by Real (14 league titles)
* lost to Brian Clough's Derby County on penalties (Colin Todd, Archie Gemmil also played)
* 1974 tie with Celtic
** contained Dalglish
** The team???s tactics on Europe???s premier stage cemented Atletico???s identity as the rough, dark, dangerous outlaws of Spanish football.
* 1974 European Cup final
** Luis Aragones swansong
* Intercontinental Cup win
** Bayern declined to play
** Had to wait 29 days for the return fixture, trailing 1-0 from the first leg.
* Atletico Madrid vs Brazil (75th anniversary)

European Cup Final 1974 vs Bayern Munich (Brussels)
 
Atletico Madrid reached the European Cup final after a bruising tie with Celtic where Atletico earned a reputation as a bunch of violent thugs that make Mourinho's Chelsea look like kittens. This was to be Luis Aragones' (RIP) swansong after 16 years playing for Atletico Madrid (he would take over as manager the next season). With 1 minute remaining he scored from a free kick. Atletico were 20 seconds away from beating a Bayern side that would ultimately win 3 consecutive European Cups and feed West Germany's successful World Cup 1974 winning side. They conceded a goal from distance allegedly when goalkeeper Miguel Reina (Pepe Reina's father) was distracted by a photographer asking for his shirt. There were no penalties in those days (FIFA had introduced it in 1970 but UEFA had not adopted it yet) so the match went to a replay. Bayern won it 4-0 and Atletico would not reach another European cup final for 40 years.

==== Gil, Big changes ====
* 1987: Vicente Calderon died in March 1987, Jesus Gil elected president
6.219 votes for Gil to 3.465 the 2nd placed Sánchez de León. 
* 1987: Gil's first point of business was to sign Paulo Futre, whose Man of the Match performance in the 1987 European Cup against Bayern Munich helped the Portuguese side win the final.

==== Real, Memorable results, trophy drought ====

big wins at Bernabeu between 1985 and 1991
* 4-0 Sanchez last season (1985) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdqcsYvSWRM

==== Real, and Penalties ====
Penalty shootouts, a proposal approved during 6 days after the conclusion of the 1970 world cup, would become an innovation of great regret to Atletico.

* 1975 - lost to Real (on penalties) in final
* 1978 - beat Bilbao on penalties
* 1979 - lost to Real (on penalties)
* 1980 - lost to Real (on penalties), who would win the final against their b-team
* 1982 - lost to Real
* 1987 - beat Real in cup, lost to Real Sociedad (on penalties)
** lost to Real Sociedad in cup final (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8i9lbUeM50)
* 1989 - lost to Real
* 1991 - beat Real
* 1992 - beat Real

==== President instability ====

Another important point concerning this era (and surely related to the financial trouble) is that between 1980 and 1982 the club had five different presidents:

21. Vicente Calderón (1964–80)
22. Ricardo Irezábal (1980)
23. Alfonso Cabeza (1980–82)
24. Antonio del Hoyo (1982)
25. Agustín Cotorruelo (1982)
26. Vicente Calderón (1982–87)

Other Events: 
1979-80 Vicente Calderón resigns
1980-81 The Álvarez Margüenda scandal when we were fighting for the League
1981-82 Alfonso Cabeza banned as president. We sign the Mexican Judas
1982-83 Vicente Calderón returns. We sign Votava
1983-84 We lose the League Cup against Valladolid. Money problems.
1984-85 Cup Winners, League Runners-Up, won 0-4 at Bernabéu, Mexican Judas departs
1985-86. SuperCup winners, Cup Winners Cup Runners Up

==== Gil - signing Futre ====
Futre’s final for Porto against Bayern included Rumenigge and Matthaus
==== famous brazilians ====
* Dirceu 79-82 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAl9cskTOfk) - died in road accident aged 43
* Alemao (scored in 1986 penalty shootout)

==== Penalties ====
Hey, I actually did some research on this topic myself. The overall record is pretty horrifying - Atlético won only 2 out of 9 shooutouts. 
 
These is a table that sums up the results:
73e269.jpg
 
It includes following matches:
6.11.1974 - UEFA Cup 2nd round against Brian Clough's Derby County - lost
5.6.1975 - Copa del Rey final against Real Madrid - lost
8.2.1978 - Copa del Rey round of 16 against Athletic Bilbao - won
2.4.1979 - Copa del Rey 3rd round against Real Madrid - lost
24.5.1980 - Copa del Rey semi-final against Real Madrid - lost
27.6.1987 - Copa del Rey final against Real Sociedad - lost 
27.9.1989 - UEFA Cup 3rd round against Fiorentina - lost
24.8.2004 - UEFA Intertoto Cup final against Villareal - lost
13.12.2006 - Copa del Rey round of 16 against Levante - won
 
Player who took most penalties in these shooutouts is Juan José Rubio with 4 (2 scored, 2 missed). No one else took more than two penalties. Of these players, Rubén Ayala is the only one with a 100% record.
====   ====
85 vs Bilbao - Bilbao had won the domestic double the previous season.
====   ====
From Vigo, Addison moved back to West Bromwich to renew his partnership with Atkinson, who, in 1988, was offered the Atletico Madrid job and took his assistant with him. Addison remembers that episode with less fondness, comments in Atkinson's autobiography making his recollection of it all the more painful. Since Atkinson published his memoirs two years ago, they have not spoken.
"I've never said this to him, because I've not seen him, but he didn't cover the story properly in his book," Addison said. "From the moment we got to Madrid, Ron had a problem with the president, Jesus Gil. There was a contract dispute. To be fair to Ron, when we took over they were fourth from bottom and by the time he was sacked, at Christmas, they were fourth from top.
"But we knew something was up when Jesus phoned me in our hotel one night. I told him I didn't like the fact that he was ringing me and not Ron, and as soon as I put the phone down I told Ron immediately. `I've just had Mad Max on,' I said.
"When it came to Christmas, Ron was going home. I urged him to go and see the president first, before he left. Ron didn't, and the next day he was sacked.
"That night, over a beer, Ron knew what was coming and told me to take the job if I was offered it. He never put that in his book. Instead, he claimed the first thing I did when the offer came was moan to him that I had not been given any more money. I think Ron was hurt by the episode, but it saddens me when I think that he called me to help him with his autobiography."

Atletico Documentary

2002 - Barca away was first time in 2 years fans outside Spain had seen any moving pictures of any of these players, with TV stations covering only the top division of Spain's booming football business. Pre-youtube, the most fans could see was still pictures on sites like Marca.com and listen to spanish radiomarca coverage. 

2003 - Lost all-time 4th most successful team in Spain when Valencia beat them 3-0. This was the culmination of a rich period in Valencia's comparable history (also 9  times champions in...?) that saw them win the league title a year earlier under Rafael Benitez who had won promotion for Tenerife the same month that Atletico reemerged from the 2nd division. They would also win the league title at the end of this season and Mista's impressive form carried through to Gothenburg where  he would put in a man of the match performance to beat fabien Barthez, Didier Drogba and company at Marseilles.

2004-2005 - horrible away record. But the beginning of a great run of matches against Barcelona. 

Bianchi didn't have much luck either despite arriving as the saviour who a would restore the soul of Atletico as he had done to Boca Juniors.

The intertoto Cup penalty shootout marked the start of a gripping rivalry with Villarreal, who themselves reached the last 4 of the Champions League.

98-99 Kiko vs Sociedad (doing that salute - what's it called?)
-----------------------------


It's called the "El Arquero" aka archer's celebration.

Here's the story from Kiko how it all started - basically saying he wanted to see how the fans celebrate and he doesn't even know why he raised the arm, but afterwards they started calling it "the archer" and the rest is history:

??Por qu?? esa manera de celebrar los goles como ???El Arquero????

Ten??a ganas de mirar durante unos segundos como reaccionaban los aficionados cuando su equipo marca un gol. Hice un gol un d??a y ca?? as????? y me puse a mirar a la grada disfrutando de la alegr??a de los seguidores del Atletico. No s?? por qu?? puse el brazo para arriba. Lo llamaron arquero y queda bien, pero no pens?? ni lo que hac??a cuando me dio por celebrarlo as??. Me gusta que se me recuerde cuando lo hace ahora alg??n jugador como mis amigos Torres, Ramos, G??iza, que lo han celebrado as?? por homenaje a m??.

tips
make it interesting to people who don't care about the sport with subplots. Same way I find a mini documentary about Martina Navratilova more memorable when they mention her parents not being allowed to travel from Czechoslovakia for her first Wimbledon championship title; introduction of metal tennis rackets; lift sport into the realms of theater.
e.g.
* Torres, 16 year old when Atletico were desperate
* Gil arrest for embezzlement

The athletes are "part of a cast of characters," Neal told us on the phone yesterday. "You have to give people a reason to care about these characters."

Read more: http://www.businessinsider.com/tv-sports-isnt-about-keeping-score-its-about-telling-a-story-2011-1#ixzz36TxuMsdr

Eras make it more interesting too. e.g. passing of the torch from Navratilova to Graff

Types of stories (master version)
* odd one out (e.g. wearing something non-white at Wimbledon)
** Atletico with ultra-defensive coach - Helenio Herrera
* defying odds, underdog, wonderkid (e.g. indian summer - Gary McAllister; wonderkid - Michael Owen; Man Utd CL 1999, Tranmere Rovers cup runs)
** Atletico winning La Liga
** Fernando Torres wonderkid
* heartbreak (e.g. Liverpool 1989 losing title to Arsenal; England penalty shootouts)
** Atletico losing CL final
* tragedy that reminds us sport is just a game (Hillsborough, Munich, Bradford, Turin)
* record breakers (e.g. Arsenal invincibles 2003-2004)
** golden oldie (e.g. Dino Zoff 1982)
* unexpected twist
** Atletico Red and White stripes because Blackburn had none left
* passing of the torch/changing of the guard
* Repeat (e.g. Germany vs Holland 1978 was repeat of the 1974 final)
* 2nd coming; prodigal son; returning home
* Hero (e.g. Maradona Mexico 86)
* Villain, poor sportsmanship, bans (e.g. Zidane 2006, Cantona vs Crystal Palace, Suarez bites, John McEnroe; 
** Atletico's Hugo Sanchez joins Real Madrid
* Longevity (Martina Navratilova, Sachin Tendulkar, Ryan Giggs, Lothar Matthaus)
* end of an era
** Atletico 2000 relegation - end of 66(?) years in top flight
** Atletico 2001 - Kiko, Toni and Lopez
** Atletico 2005 - Aguilera
* end of a drought 
** Atletico derby win drought
** Atletico trophy drought
* juxtapose, irony (e.g. Maradona 1990 Napoli; Paulo Rossi ban cut to play in 1982 and finished top scorer; Edgar Davids managing Barnet)
** e.g. victory in the midst of controversy (Italy winning in 1982)
* unescapable turmoil
** financial problems (Atletico 2000)
* controversy, scandals (e.g. cheating)
** Atletico - Futre & Real goalkeeper
* revenge/redemption (e.g. Stuart Pearce scoring penalty at Euro 96; Ronaldo scoring in World Cup 2002 final; Beckham helping eliminate Argentina 2002)
** political conflict backdrop (Iran vs USA; England vs Argentina)
* Coincidence, history repeating, paying homage to history gesture (e.g. Spanish goalkeeper jersey from 1984 at Euro 2008; Italy winning world cup in 2006 at the time of biscotto)
** Atletico beating Real twice in cup final at their stadium in 1960s
** 2012 Bilbao vs Atletico
* contingents (e.g. Man Utd class of 92; Southampton 2013; Galacticos)
* leadup to iconic image
* Incredible talent (e.g. Zidane - epitomized by 2001 CL final)
* Epic battle (e.g. Inter vs Milan = Germany vs Netherlands)
* Relationships - Epic rivalry, friendships/allegiances (e.g. Connors vs McEnroe, Becker vs Edberg, England vs Germany!)
** Atletico vs Barcelona 1990s
** Atletico beat Real in Cup final 1992, 2013
* How times have changed (e.g. world cup travel by ships, sharing journey with other countries)
* huge growth (e.g. only 17,000 fans watched European championshiop final in Paris in 1960)

7 basic plots
* slaying the monster
* rags to riches
* quest
* voyage and return
* comedy
* tragedy
* rebirth

As I continue to think about this Atletico documentary, I notice that the masterpieces of videography that are most memorable, and appeal to the casual viewer, are dramatized by leveraging the human tendency to remember stories.

Watching some footage of the Wimbledon championships despite only being a casual tennis fan, I see the importance of it. What are the various types of stories in football, or examples of such stories? Here are some I can think of:

=== Stock Music ===
Remember the objective of music is not to show people how cool you are. It???s mostly to transport people back to that time (and location). Occasionally to elicit an emotion (e.g. tension, sadness, euphoria, relief) - though European style doesn???t exaggerate it the way American sports does so think about your audience.

Also, the music should not dominate. It shouldn't be too" "good" so that viewers notice it. The main reason to put music in is because empty sound is very noticeable (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVJBAD-Ru4c)

=== Seamlessness ===
Transitions should be seamless, using clever segues (e.g. Valencia cup final defeat to Ranieri to  relegation). Don’t make it feel like a list by breaking it up into subvideos (even in rapid release mode) on decades or presidents. For making notes it’s fine because you need quick random-access, but not for the presentation. It’s like going on a ride that you have to change seats 10 times. You can’t put your feet up and enjoy the experience (related to local suboptimization fallacy). It’s different with, say, an audiobook where you need to pick things up in the middle at the beginning of a new car journey.

Story cuts through the clutter and strips things down to what matters most. Story says, “look here… focus on this.” As Chip and Dan Heath put it in Made to Stick, storytelling leaders must be “masters of exclusion,” relentlessly prioritizing information - See more at: http://castasone.com/five-habits-of-a-storyteller/#sthash.9c00sm2O.dpuf

Atletico documentary
Maybe the best trick is to use only 5 second snippets of songs as you're displaying a full screen graphic of the match - when and where it took place, and maybe who played.

Alternatively, have 30 second slow motion montage (must use different camera angles to live action) after each game. Well, not EVERY game.
=== ===
Atletico documentary

If you use rock music as your soundtrack for everything its going to compress the range of emotions into some small range. But you want the emotions to be exaggerated in both extremes.

=== ===

Atletico documentary
Don't (generally) put game footage against music. Only for pre game setting the stage, post game fallout (celebrations), or montages with closeups of players in action.
=== ===
Atletico documentary continuity vs breaks.

Perhaps use the debut of the longest serving player in the first team that ends in winning a trophy as the beginning of an chapter/era.

e.g. the team that won the Europa League contained Antonio Lopez. You could use his debut in 2001 as the start of the chapter.

But what would be the start of the next chapter? If you make it immediately after the first trophy in a mini spell it will make each chapter look like a collapse. On the other hand if you make the ending of a chapter the last trophy before a drought then the viewer will be desensitized to all the success. On the other hand if you stretch the success too much it will not capture the spirit of the documentary which is supposed to be savoring every moment f success.

There are many known routes to success in football. Rich owners. Great managers. Huge fanbases. Luck.

For clubs that aren't fortunate to inherit any of these traditional keys to success, it's widely accepted for their fans to live a lifetime of exclusion and ridicule.

But for one Spanish club grudging respect is not the result. It makes them them shout louder, tackle harder, and stretch themselves further. Like the American Indians who would rather die than live subserviently to their conqueror.

A club that has had to fight for its rights. Atletico Madrid's alternate blueprint for success is a hybrid of outlaws deemed inappropriate for clubs with an aristocratic image, on misfits whose talent could not be unlocked when surrounded by superstars, and on gambling with undiscovered talent.

This is the story of Atletico Madrid. 

Bilbao is a region of outlaws, so much so they started their own club

Atletico documentary tip
Do not bunch identical fixtures together - it leaves the viewer feeling they can ignore what's coming up if they're not interested in that fixture (even if it's against a big team).
It feels like a lazy amateur compilation rather than a story with unexpected twists.
So don't put lots of classics against Barcelona together. You have to mix it up.

=== Introduction ===
==== Difference between Atletico Madrid and Real Madrid ====

Madrid's other team and, to all Glasgow Celtic fans, one of the most vicious bunch of thugs ever to take the field in a European Cup tie. El Atleti have always lived under the giant shadow of Real; a pauper compared to Real's aristocracy. While Real are all style, Atletico have earned a reputation as the thought police of world football. However, times have changed and the likes of Juninho have blunted the hard edge.

===== =====

Atletico’s successes are a mere footnote in the glorious legacy that is Real.
Real - a trophy each season is about as remarkable as having breakfast each morning. Atletico - every triumph, big or small is savoured as a feast in the midst of perpetual famine.

“For Madrid, winning is an obligation, for Atletico it’s a gift,” shrugs Oscar, an Atletico fan with an uncontrollable curly mop of hair. Another fan, Javi, agrees: “Madrid is Disney,” he says. “Atletico is more real, more frustrating, more about hope and emotion – it’s beautiful,  horrifying and tender.”

Boom (1987-1992) - Gil takeover, Derby demolitions, Cup finals
Bust (1993-1994)- Raul scoring on debut against Atletico

Bust (2003-2011) - centenary embarrassment (Osasuna), derby drought (06-07 two 1-1 draws - Torres and Aguero rare game together), hammerings against Barcelona (6-0, , 6-1, , 5-2, 5-0)
Boom (2008-2014) - great comebacks (Villarreal 4-4, Espanyol 3-2, Villarreal 3-2), return to CL and Aguero comes of age (PSV 3-0, Barcelona 4-3), win Europa (Fulham, Inter), Simeone almost wins all trophies (Bilbao, Chelsea, Barcelona, Real)
Bust - lost CL final, sold best players

* Reasons for feeling (motivos de un sentimiento)

=== What casual people know the club as ===
Atletico Madrid. The Spanish capital???s lesser-known team. Success has never been taken for granted by the Atletico faithful. But the 9-time Spanish champions guarantee, in the words of one fan, ???Tradition, emotion, fun and football.???

=== What this video is ===
We chronicle the 100-plus year history of the club to understand, ???Just who are Atletico Madrid???? Along the way we consider what makes the club unique; what are some of the most significant events and people in its history, and why do fans choose to join the tribe.

=== What the more knowledgeable football fans know from modern times ===
Below the surface of the Spanish Primera Liga, dominated by Real Madrid and Barcelona lurks a secondary group of proud entities with their own pedigrees. Valencia from the Costa Blanca, Basque institution Athletic Bilbao, Galician side Deportivo La Coruna, Andalucian juggernaut Sevilla and Atletico Madrid.

Some of the greats in the sport came to prominence on these premeses. World Cup Winner Mario Kempes at Valencia, Bebeto and Rivaldo at Deportivo La Coruna. 

//Living god Diego Maradona spent time at Sevilla.

* show familiar world cup footage
** mario kempes world cup winning goal
** bebeto baby rocking
** rivaldo goal against belgium (or more suitable against Denmark)
** Jordi Alba (2nd goal against Italy in 2012)
** Ariel Ortega
** David Villa (winner against Portugal I think in 2010)
** Claudio Lopez (vs Holland 1998)
//** maradona solo against England

You need not look hard to find household names in the lineage of Atletico Madrid (don???t talk about strikers yet)

* Caminero (USA 94)
* Kiko (France 1998)
* Simeone (France 98)
* Hugo Sanchez (Mexico 86)
* Bernd Schuster (Euro 80)
* Ayala (1974) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2Ygwr0Wnvg
* Maxi Rodriguez
* Vava

// Shame we can???t mention Paulo Futre since Portugal never qualified for anything

Clubs of this scale have traded eras in the wilderness, and on cloud 9. Heartbreaking relegation, European escapades, financial turmoil, and cup success dot their histories. To say Atletico Madrid have been to hell and back would be an understatement. 

====   ====
A form of existence where winning is a footnote

====  ====
the effort and sacrafice past generations put for the Atletico de Madrid amblem. One of the reasons I cheer for Atletico Madrid is the fighting spirit, how much fans love this club, it is not about the money, commercials or the football stars, it's about prestige, dominance and comptetion. In the first game of semifinals against Chelsea, speakingly live from the stadium, one Serbian comentator said "I was on the lots of stadiums, and I never heard cheering that loud how atletico fans are cheering for their team today." And if Atletico Madrid loose the all battles, one thing stays the same, the passion this players, this coachign stuff and their fans have for this club.
====  ====

For most of the past 40 years, Atlético Madrid has been the New York Mets of Spanish soccer to Real Madrid's Yankees—a gritty, sometimes comically inept afterthought in a city known for championships.

=== The fan feeling ===
Atletico Madrid fans, antimadridistas, are defiant by nature. The regard their neighbours as conformists, the institutional, political, aristocratic franchise. ???Real??? literally means ???Royal.??? Atletico fans take pride in standing up against authority.

For generations the club has been seen as serving/representing the working class section of Madrid, giving the modest earners a voice, reminding the world they as a population exist.

Once a week, the fans congregate on the banks of Madrid???s Manzanares river to celebrate a sense of belonging, engaging in entertainment inkeeping with their individual simple lifestyles (show pictures of singing, fires etc), often in the absence of victory. Atletico Madrid is an expression of unashamed pride in these people???s identities. (show picture of old Calderon - ???giant circus tent???)

=== Spanish football origins ===

To understand how Atletico Madrid came into being, one has to take a step back to see where Spanish football itself came from.

The British are widely accepted as the inventors of the beautiful game in the mid 1800s.

Railway workers?

=== Athletic Bilbao ===
Bilbao - had Madrid branch?
The Bilbao club got their shirts from Blackburn Rovers.

In 19XX, 

=== Nicknames ===
The Indians. The Mattress Makers. The Red and Whites. The Anti-Madridistas. 




=== Barcelona goal fests ===
In 1987, Barcelona had won only 1 more league title than Atletico Madrid. But in the early 1990s, Barcelona had established a dynasty. Johan Cruyff, already a legend as a player, lead them to 4 successive league titles as well as their first European Cup at Wembley against Sampdoria.

==== Atletico 4-3 Barcelona ====
http://watchthismatch.blogspot.com/2012/04/atletico-madrid-4-0-barcelona-3-3.html
They visited the Vicente Calderon that had just undergone refurbishment that saw the front seats removed. The visitors raced into a 3 goal half time lead with a hattrick by soon to be World Cup winning Brazilian striker Romario. A brace from Polish striker Roman Kosecki brought Atletico back to 3-3, before an 89th minute winner from a young Real Madrid reject named Jose Luis Caminero, who himself would go on to achieve worldwide recognition in the United States that summer.

This was a rare escape from a period of turmoil for the club. In the calendar years of 1993 and 1994, Jesus Gil changed coaches 8 times. By the end of the 1995 season, Atletico Madrid finished 14, their lowest league finish since the 1940s(?). The only avoided relegation playoffs by 1 point. Months later, one of Jesus Gil's most high profile incidents was an unsavory incident, punching Fildago.

On the field, Atletico Madrid started punching above their more modest weight, under the guidance of former Luton Town defender and Serbian coach Radmonir Antic (video of speech: at beginning of season http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-YeGz5-Jf8). Kiko Navaez, who scored the injury time winning goal that won his country an Olympic gold medal (video available), led the line. They also went on a heroic cup run, epitomised by this semi final win against league title challengers Valencia coached by a figure familiar to Atletico fans. Valencia had Serbian striker Pedrag Mijatovic in their ranks, but it was Atletico's Serbian forward Milinko Pantic's 2nd half brace that helped Atletico to a 5-3 first leg victory having trailed at half time (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=509NlMUeO6w).

The final, contested a month before the end of the league season at the Romerada, home of Real Zaragoza where Radomir Antic spent 2 years as a player and 2 years as coach. It was also the same stadium where Puskas and Di Stefano had denied Atletico a European Cup final 36 years earlier. There were no goals in 90 minutes, but Pantic popped up late in the first period of extra time with the only goal.

With 1 trophy in the bag, they would to to the home of the runners' up stadium and win 3-1. However, a 3-2 home defeat to Valencia at the end of April kept the contest for the league open until the final day. Leading by 2 points, Atletico Madrid needed a win against Inaki Saez's Albacete to seal their first title since 1977. Diego Simeone headed Atletico into the lead after 15 minutes. Kiko doubled the lead on 30 minutes with his 13th goal for Atletico that season in all competitions (http://www.infoatleti.es/jugador/kiko). (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSlOvn7WGkM).

Atletico's sole Super Cup victory came 11 years earlier against Barcelona. They would contest the 2 legged tie of 1996 against the same team now with Bobby Robson in charge. Following his home country's best World Cup run on foreign soil, the Englishman had spent the previous 6 years in Holland and Portugal. Curiously both teams' home stadiums were unavailable and were played at the 55,000 seat Montju??c stadium, home of the 1992 Olympics and to become Espanyol's home stadium for a decade a year later, and the Peineta located in eastern Madrid with a mere 15,000 seats. The first leg result was disappointing, with Barcelona winning 5-2. New Brazilian signing Ronaldo, a month shy of his 20th birthday, would grab a brace for the home side. More significantly a rare homage to Atletico's formative years when they wore shirts resembling Blackburn Rovers' colours (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWiTIK38l9U). Atletico came close to restoring parity in the 2nd leg but would ultimately not claim their second Super Cup. The 6-5 aggregate score gave hints of more goal laden games that would unfold that season. In the league, Atletico would earn a 3-3 draw at the Nou Camp with Esnaider, signed from Real Madrid in the summer, almost winning the game for Atletico. The copa del rey quarter final was extraordinary. Following a 2-2 draw in Madrid, Atletico raced into a 3-0 half-time lead at the Nou Camp with all goals coming from Pantic who would add a 4th in the 2nd half. A 2nd half hattrick from Ronaldo would not have been enough to deny Atletico their semi final place, but a goal 10 minutes from the end from Pizzi ensured that Atletico would not repeat their cup triump a year earlier. Barcelona would go on to lift the trophy (in addition to the Cup Winners' Cup). When April of 1997 came around, Barcelona ended their series of 6 games with Atletico that season as they began it - a 5-2 victory. The Brazilian scored a hattrick en route to retaining his FIFA World Player of the Year award. (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnRS1u7OVos)


=== Ending ===

No one can predict what Atletico Madrid???s immediate or distant future will hold. But with the undying support the Rojiblancos have, no amount of controversy can threaten the club???s existence. One thing is for certain, the fans can continue to expect extreme highs and lows that capture the hearts of football fans who appreciate an adventure through the extremes of human emotion.
